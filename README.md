# Calculator-with-Variables
An expansion of my calculator program, this one now accepts variables as inputs and stores their values in a hash table for referencing
____

Fully functional calculator that evaluates a user-inputted expression and returns its value

Tokenizes the expression into an array of strings and arranges them into Reverse Polish (postfix) notation

The converted expression is then evaluated using stacks and queues and returned as a double

Program is capable of storing values in specified variables (x, y, z, etc.) by hash table implementation
